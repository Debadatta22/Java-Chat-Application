The server handles multiple clients simultaneously using multi-threading, and chat history is saved locally for future reference.
Conclusion
This Java Chat Application (SyntaxTalk) is a beginner-level real-time chat system, developed using Swing GUI, Socket Programming, and Multi-threading concepts. It successfully allows secure user login, multi-user communication, and chat history management. With future improvements like file sharing, end-to-end encryption, and modern UI enhancements, this project can be further optimized for professional use.


🌟 "SYNTAXTALK - A Java-Based Real-Time Chat System"
In today's digital world, communication plays a vital role in connecting people. With the increasing demand for secure and efficient chat applications, we aim to design and develop a real-time chat system using core Java concepts. Our project, "SyntaxTalk", is a basic yet powerful multi-user chat application, where users can login with credentials, communicate in real-time, and customize their chat interface.

Unlike traditional chat systems, SyntaxTalk focuses on simplicity, user-friendly interface, and smooth interaction. It leverages Java's powerful multithreading and socket programming concepts to enable seamless message exchange between multiple users on a local network. Additionally, the chat history feature allows users to view past messages and search for specific conversations.

This project serves as a foundation for building advanced chat systems, where future enhancements like end-to-end encryption, file sharing, private messaging, and web-based UI design can be integrated.
